#Angular Music App

This app is made using Angular version 4 and Multer. Multer was used to store locally the files and using Nodejs Fs tool to work with. 
This was originally created with the purpose of using it on Electron. However, electron doesn't utilize express and this was not meant to be used on a website. however, this will work under local server. 
It will be later on converted to work with electron and then have a desktop running apps only. 


To use this just go to folder and type `npm install` and once installed
then enter this command  `ng build && node server.js`.
It will load on to the local server and the user shall be able to player on the local server.

### Note
There is still work to be done like only being able to select music files and not any other files. 
However, this is capable of getting the music file and storing it where locally it was made.
